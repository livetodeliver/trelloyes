# Trelloyes Project (Non-working Trello Clone)

This was my first React.js project to learn how to:

* set up a React project using create-react-app  
* create React components

This project was an assignment as part of [Thinkful's Full-Stack Flex Program](https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamp/web-development/flexible/) and created from provided starter files.
